**Altica** is a sovereign, decentralized, and privacy-respecting naming protocol for the next-generation internet. Built from the ground up by [Infrade](https://github.com/infrade), Altica offers a new root namespace, decentralized resolver stack, and ZK-powered query resolution to address the flaws of legacy DNS and existing Web3 naming solutions.

## üåê Key Features

- **Root-Native Sovereignty** ‚Äì Altica operates its own root (e.g., `.alt`) independent of ICANN or legacy DNS authorities.
- **Decentralized Resolution** ‚Äì Uses `libp2p`, `IPFS`, and DHT-based routing for fault-tolerant, censorship-resistant resolution.
- **ZK Query Privacy** ‚Äì Integrated zero-knowledge proof layer to ensure users can resolve names without revealing identities.
- **DNS Interoperability** ‚Äì Fallback gateways to enable compatibility with traditional DNS clients and systems.

## üöÄ Use Cases

- Censorship-resistant website and dApp naming  
- Private, anonymous domain queries in hostile environments  
- Public good infrastructure for Web3 ecosystems  
- Custom namespaces for DAOs, DePINs, and digital communities
